Crap Flinging Monkey is a simple site about developer hell.  It was spawned from an IRC conversation, which I happen to have a log of:

12:31 &lt; josh&gt; we should ditch gomez and use this
12:31 &lt; josh&gt; http://www.uptimeparty.com/
12:37 &lt;@bpreston&gt; how about we ditch you and use this - http://crapflingingmonkey.com
12:37 &lt; phUnk&gt; lollin'
12:38 &lt;@bpreston&gt; I have a keyboard wallposter it can "type" its code on
12:39 &lt; phUnk&gt; %whatis bpreston
12:39 &lt; shake&gt; phUnk: "bpreston" could be the winnar
12:40 &lt; phUnk&gt; i'm inclined to agree.
12:41 &lt;@bpreston&gt; \o/
12:47 &lt; josh&gt; bpreston: i think i'm going to buy that and use it as my blog

Immediately after saying that, I rushed to purchase the blog.  Only a few seconds after I purchased it, bpreston pinged me on IRC and said a simple "I hate you".  It turned out, I got the domain right before he did!  So, instead of letting it sit there like all the other sites, I figured I would turn it into something.  And here it is.
