What's up, cracker.  Listen to the beat and get the codin' going.  Feelin' the keys beneath the fingers.  No time to stop at Wingers, for fries and lies and all the colorful colors.  Gotta get coding, the day is nigh.  When we release, it's gonna be big, like the kid on a bike riding for the first time.  So no time for the playin', just get the groove on, get in the zone, hack it out... no talking on the phone.  No meetings are important enough.  We've got all the right stuff.  This is what we'll never forget.  Blow any idea of algorithms out the door, we come up with our own shi'.  I'm not throwin' a fit.  Stick to the music, the keys, the Code.  That's what it's all about, yo!
