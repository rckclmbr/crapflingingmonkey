Last weekend I biked my first century.  It was an "easy" course and was supposed to be a beautiful day.  I wasn't expecting anything to go wrong, but as luck would have it, a lot did.  I struggled to finish.

Looking back, I think there are a few reasons why it wasn't as easy as I had hoped:
<ul>
	<li>I got 5 hours of sleep the night before</li>
	<li>I didn't train much</li>
	<li>I didn't drink enough water the night/week before</li>
	<li>I got lost, and ended up biking an extra six miles</li>
</ul>
Whoa, back up... what was that last one?
<h2>"I ended up biking an extra six miles"</h2>
I'd like to call these my "bonus miles".  Even though I went off-course at the time, lost a few minutes off my time, and made the rest of the race a little harder... it forced me to push myself a further, get a better workout, and gave me the confidence that if needed, I can go even further.  It also taught me a valuable lesson -- don't get lost.  So even though it was a short-term loss, it ended up being a long-term gain.
<h2>So how does this relate to programming?</h2>
Bonus coding.  Sometimes we get lost in what we are programming.  Sometimes it's a miscommunication.  Sometimes it's a false assumption.  But often times we find ourselves in a place where we've coded for a long amount of time and end up having to <em>throw it all away</em>.  It's not the best feeling in the world -- it actually makes you feel like you've just wasted valuable time from your life.  But it's more than that.  You've gained more experience in the <em>wrong</em> way to code.  Like biking, it's a short-term loss, but a long-term gain.  Just learn from it and try not to repeat the same mistakes.

Just remember in your coding that your career isn't a sprint, it's a century -- a marathon.  Go at a steady pace, learn from your mistakes, and don't get yourself down at short-term losses.
