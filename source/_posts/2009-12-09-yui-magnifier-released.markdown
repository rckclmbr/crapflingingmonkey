A coworker of mine, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dustinmcquay">Dustin McQuay</a>, released the <a href="http://github.com/dmcquay/YUI-Magnifier" target="_blank">YUI Magnifier</a>, a YUI implementation of other popular image zoom utilities.   We were actually surprised to see that nothing else like it already existed for YUI, so Dustin took the challenge of building his own, with the hopes that it might be included in other larger YUI libraries.

It boasts the features:
<ul>
	<li> Display a magnified portion of an image, which is controlled by where the mouse is hovering over the image</li>
	<li>Control over styling</li>
	<li>Control over location of magnification lens</li>
	<li>Magnified image can be wrapped by a larger element</li>
</ul>
Though the release wasn't very public, it was still quite an accomplishment. It happens to be one of the first open-source releases from <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/">Backcountry.com</a> (preceded to my knowledge by only <a href="http://bucardo.org/">Bucardo</a>, a Postgres replication application written for Backcountry.com by <a href="http://www.endpoint.com/" target="_blank">Endpoint</a>).  It was originally designed to be used for our 900x900 images, but got cut after development has essentially finished due to changed requirements.

It's a pretty solid application, and hopefully the start of more open source to be coming out of Backcountry.com
