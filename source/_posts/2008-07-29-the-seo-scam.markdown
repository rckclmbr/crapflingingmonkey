It seems like every business I work with is paying loads of money for SEO work to be done.  While SEO is extremely important for larger web-based companies, it's just not applicable, to the scale SEO companies want you to think, to smaller companies with a little web presence.  However, that's exactly where 'SEO Optimization' companies are focused -- they want to make a quick, easy buck off a local company.  While this is great for the SEO Company, small businesses are getting ripped off without even knowing it.  I've tried to narrow down why exactly SEO companies are so successful at gaining customers:

<strong>Obscure Definition of Optimization</strong>

Nobody knows how Google, or any search engine for that matter, works.  Nobody.  This is why so many non-techy, quick-to-make-a-buck people are so quick to jump on it -- they can say whatever they want, people will listen to them, and nobody can tell them for sure if they are wrong.  This is the main reason why most SEO Optimization companies are a couple of ex-Radioshack salesmen, accompanied by their iPhone, attend small business conventions and conferences, suckering in the less tech-savvy SBO.

<strong>Non-measurable Results</strong>

Any un-accredited SEO firm won't supply local businesses with the proper tools to analyze how much the SEO optimization really isn't doing anything for them.  With analytics tools such as <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> available, small business owners can see just how much the SEO company really sucks at what they do, and how little difference they really make.  SEO companies won't even direct the SBO towards its presence.

<strong>Every Company Wants to Be Number One</strong>

This is probably the biggest reason why these companies are so successful -- the average SBO wants to get traffic.  To do that, they feel like they should be in the top results.  However, they don't feel like paid search is valuable, since it's most often on a pay-per-click basis.  They feel like a single, swift payment to 'optimize' their site will yield long-term benefit.  After all, they're paying for it.  The fact is, it won't.  Web-based companies allocate vast amounts of resources to keep content fresh and clean.  A small website for a local company simply can't, and shouldn't keep up.  There will always be a place for them, but Amazon will always be in search results before Fred's Corner Shop (unless, of course, Fred's Corner Shop was web-based and allocated a lot of time and money toward becoming #1).  The month or so (hah, why do they take a month?) that SEO Optimization companies work on a site just doesn't provide enough to keep a site fresh for even a year.

So, I can't provide rants without making a few suggestions the SBOs.  Hire a kid out of high school, have him put up some meta keywords and description relevant to your site, and make sure links throughout your site have descriptive text instead of just 'click here'.  Also, talk to any business partners and get them to put a link to your site.  Most importantly, put some <em>CONTENT</em> on your website.  That's it.

Keep in mind I'm not bagging on SEO for web-based companies.  It really is important to make sure certain stuff happens like only one URL per page, rel="nofollow" attributes are attached with valid links, page weight is low, have a siteindex, don't have hidden elements with bogus content, [insert BS SEO optimization rule here...].
